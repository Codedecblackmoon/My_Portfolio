ðŸš€ **Welcome to My Portfolio!**  
I'm super excited to share my just-finished portfolio, showcasing my skills and creativity in web development and design. Here's what you can expect:

## Technologies Used
- **React**
- **TypeScript**
- **HTML**
- **CSS**
- **Email.js API** (for seamless message handling)

## Unique Features
âœ¨ To make it stand out, I included:
- **Custom SVGs** designed from scratch.
- **Custom Backgrounds** to add personality.
- **Micro Animations** on buttons to enhance the user experience (UX).
